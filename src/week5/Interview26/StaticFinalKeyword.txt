Hereâ€™s a concise comparison of `final` and `static` in Java:

| **Aspect**                | **`final`**                                                | **`static`**                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Used to declare constants, prevent overriding/inheritance, or reassignment. | Used to define class-level variables or methods. |
| **Applies To**            | Variables, methods, and classes.                          | Variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes.  |
| **Effect** on Variables   | The value cannot be changed once assigned.                | Shared among all instances of the class.         |
| **Effect** on Methods     | Prevents the method from being overridden.                | Makes the method belong to the class, not an instance. |
| **Effect** on Classes     | Prevents the class from being extended (inherited).       | Not applicable to the entire class, but used for nested classes. |
| **Access**                | Instance-specific (non-static).                           | Shared, accessed using the class name.           |
| **Memory**                | Stored in object-specific memory.                         | Stored in the class's memory (only one copy exists). |

### Example:

#### Using `final`:
```java
public class FinalExample {
    final int x = 10; // Cannot be reassigned

    final void display() {
        System.out.println("This method cannot be overridden.");
    }
}

class Child extends FinalExample {
    // void display() { } // Compilation error, cannot override a final method
}
```

#### Using `static`:
```java
public class StaticExample {
    static int count = 0; // Shared among all instances

    static void displayCount() {
        System.out.println("Count: " + count);
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticExample.count = 5; // Accessed using the class name
        StaticExample.displayCount(); // Prints: Count: 5
    }
}
```

### Key Differences:
1. **Purpose**:
   - `final` focuses on immutability (cannot be changed/extended).
   - `static` focuses on sharing class-level resources.

2. **Usage**:
   - `final` is for constants, securing methods, and preventing inheritance.
   - `static` is for class-level variables, methods, and blocks.
