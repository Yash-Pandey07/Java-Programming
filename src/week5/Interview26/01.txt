What all data structure are call by value and call by reference
Difference between final vs static
primitive data types are called by valur or reference

%
Primitive data types are **called by value**.
This means that when you pass a primitive type
(e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`) to a method, a copy of the value is passed, and changes to the parameter
inside the method do not affect the original value.
